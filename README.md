# EEB-01 - Decoding Hibernation
# RNAseq_analysis_brown_bear_adipose
The purpose of our project is to identify the gene expression changes in the gene families of our organism of interest: the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) during hibernation. Such changes include reductions in body temperature, metabolic suppression, and temporary insulin resistance. In our project, we viewed RNA samples from real brown bear adipose tissue using both wet lab (pipetting, qPCR, gel electrophoresis) and computational tools including Hummingbird Computational Cluster (combination of Python, Linux, and R) and RStudio. As bears remarkably evade the detrimental health effects associated with prolonged inactivity in humans, our findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to treat human/animal diseases, including potential therapeutic approaches for muscle-wasting.
